# 用户接口


## 启动画面

启动Blender时，启动画面会出现在窗口的中央。 它包含帮助链接和最近打开的Blender文件。 下面可以看到更详细的描述。

## 介绍

启动Blender并关闭Splash Screen之后，Blender窗口应该与下面的图像类似。 Blender的用户界面在所有平台上都是一致的。

### Interface Elements

Window -> Screen ->  Areas ->  Editors ->  Regions ->  (Tabs) ->  Panels ->  Controls


The interface can be customized to match specific tasks using Screen Layouts, which can then be named and saved for later use. The default screen is described below.

A screen is organized into one or more Areas with each area containing an Editor.

### The Default Screen

By default Blender starts up showing the default screen, which is separated into five areas containing the Editors listed below:

* The Info Editor at the top.
* A large 3D View.
* A Timeline at the bottom.
* An Outliner at the top right.
* A Properties Editor at the bottom right.

### Components of an Editor

In general an editor provides a way to view and modify your work through a specific part of Blender. 
Editors are divided into Regions. Regions can have smaller structuring elements like tabs and panels with buttons, 
controls and widgets placed within them.

### User Interface Principles

Non Overlapping
* The UI is designed to allow you to view all relevant options and tools at a glance without pushing or dragging editors around.
Non Blocking
* Tools and interface options do not block the user from any other parts of Blender. 
Blender typically does not use pop-up boxes (requiring users to fill in data before running an operation).
Non Modal Tools
* Tools can be accessed efficiently without taking time to select between different tools. 
Many tools use consistent and predictable, mouse and keyboard actions for interaction.


### Customization
Blender also makes heavy use of keyboard shortcuts to speed up work. These can also be customized in the Keymap Editor.

### Theme colors

Blender allows for most of its interface color settings to be changed to suit the needs of the user. If you find that the colors you see on screen do not match those mentioned in the Manual then it could be that your default theme has been altered. Creating a new theme or selecting/altering a pre-existing one can be done by selecting the User Preferences editor and clicking on the Themes tab.
